CM API to stop role on a host 

The following is an example of how to stop roles on a host:

In order to stop one or more services on host in the cluster, you must use the API endpoint, "/clusters/{clusterName}/services/{serviceName}/roleCommands/stop." 


The following is a generic example of how you would use the following endpoints to stop ONE role on a node:

1. First you need to get the "hostId" of the host where the service/role is located.


2. Next, you need to use the hostid to get the "roleName" 
http://localhost:7180/api/v18/<hostid>?view=full 

EXAMPLE: 
http://localhost:7180/api/v18/hosts/38f4042c-8401-45ed-b57a-7cfcbac37c2e?view=full 


3. From the output, get the "serviceName" and "roleName" of the role you want to stop. In the following example we are going to stop the YARN service and role:

serviceName = yarn 
roleName = yarn-RESOURCEMANAGER-4ea04f09a3a5a76e0d77536801dca39b

curl -u 'admin:admin' -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"items":["yarn-RESOURCEMANAGER-4ea04f09a3a5a76e0d77536801dca39b"]}' 'http://10.17.101.129:7180/api/v18/clusters/Cluster%201/services/yarn/roleCommands/stop'
